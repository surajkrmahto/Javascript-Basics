    <h1>Hello World </h1>
   <script>
    // this is my first js code
    console.log('hello world');
    </script> 
</body>
</html>

<!--There are two places where script element can be added 
    -> head section 
    -> body section
    the best practice is to put the script at the end of body section 
    because 
    1. browser run the file top to bottom and lot of javascript file will unable to load the other element of html as there are too many things to run in javascript file and give bad user experience.
    2. script needs to talk with the elements of web pages and element are render by the browser
